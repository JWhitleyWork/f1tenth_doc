Optional Compute: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
=========================================

In place of the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module, an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit can be used. However, the software setup for this module is significantly different than the setup for the TX2. Unlike the TX2, the Xavier NX does not require any special software on the Host/Pit computer.

**Equipment Used:**

* Pit/Host laptop/computer running any Operating System
* Fully-built F1TENTH vehicle
* microSD card (16GB minimum)
* USB micro cable (must have both data and power wires)
* microSD card reader/writer for Pit/Host PC
* SD card image burning software (e.g. Balena Etcher)
* Terminal emulation software (e.g. PuTTy, screen, miniterm.py, etc.)

**Approximate Time Investment:** 1-2 hours

Initial Configuration Steps
---------------------------

14. Connect the battery on the F1TENTH vehicle.
15. Flip the switch on the power distribution board to the ON position.
16. After several minutes, you should see a new drive become available on the host PC called "L4T-README." If you do not see this then either the flashing of the microSD card failed or your USB cable is bad or incorrect in some way (e.g. missing data lines).
17. In addition to the new drive, you should also have a new Serial, COM, or TTY device available. On Linux and MacOS, this will be in the form of /dev/ttyACMx where x is a number. On Windows, this will be a new COM port. Open your terminal emulator software and connect to this new port using the following settings:

* Baud rate: 115200 bps
* Data bits: 8
* Stop bits: 1
* Parity: None
* Flow control: None

18. Once connected, you may not see any output on the terminal. Hitting the space bar should show you the license agreement for the NVIDIA software.

Configuring WiFi and SSH
------------------------

1. We will use the Network Manager command-line tool nmcli to configure the WiFi on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX. To find the interface name of your WiFi adapter, start by typing ``nmcli d`` and hitting ENTER. This will list your available interfaces. My wifi interface is named ``wlan0`` so I will use that in all future steps. If your WiFi interface is named something different, you will have to replace that in future commands.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-1.png
                :align: center

                WiFi network selection.

2. To make sure that your WiFi radio is turned on, type ``nmcli r wifi on`` and hit ENTER. This will not show anything on the terminal if the command succeeded.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-2.png
                :align: center

                Enable WiFi radio.

3. To see the list of WiFi SSIDs that your WiFi adapter can see, type ``nmcli d wifi list`` and hit ENTER. After the list is printed, hit ``q`` to continue.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-3.png
                :align: center

                WiFi SSID selection.

4. To connect to a specific WiFi SSID, use the command ``sudo nmcli d wifi connect [SSID] password [PASSWORD]`` where ``[SSID]`` is replaced with the SSID with which you want to connect and ``[PASSWORD]`` is replaced with the password to connect to that SSID. Hit ENTER.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-4.png
                :align: center

                Connect to specific WiFi network.

5. If the connection was successful, you should see the message ``Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with [GUID]``.
6. By default, WiFi will be connected using DHCP which means you may get a new IP address each time the device is turned on. In the next steps, we will configure the WiFi connection with a static IP address so you can SSH into the Developer Kit reliably. To set a static IP address, you will need to know the subnet, IP address range, and gateway of your wifi network.
7. To get the currently-assigned IP address use the command ``ip addr show dev wlan0``.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-7.png
                :align: center

                Currently-connected WiFi IP address.

8. To set a static IP address, you will also need to know the name of the connection. This is usually the same as the SSID of the WiFi network but not always. To see the list of current connections, use the command ``nmcli c show``.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-8.png
                :align: center

                List of connections.

9. To set a static IP address use the command ``sudo nmcli c mod [CONNECTION_NAME] ipv4.address [NEW_ADDRESS]/[CIDR]`` where ``[CONNECTION_NAME]`` is replaced with the name of your WiFi connection that you got from step 8, ``[NEW_ADDRESS]`` is replaced with the static IP address that you want to set, and ``[CIDR]`` is the `CIDR representation <https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/cidr-classless-inter-domain-routing/>`_ of the subnet (usually 24).

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-9.png
                :align: center

                Setting static IP address.

10. To set the connection's default gateway, use the command ``sudo nmcli c mod [CONNECTION_NAME] ipv4.gateway [GATEWAY_IP]`` where ``[CONNECTION_NAME]`` is replaced with the name of your WiFi connection that you got from step 8 and ``[GATEWAY_IP]`` is replaced with the IP address of your WiFi network's gateway/router.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-10.png
                :align: center

                Setting IP gateway.

11. To set the connection's DNS servers, use the command ``sudo nmcli c mod [CONNECTION_NAME] ipv4.dns "[DNS_SERVER1]"`` where ``[CONNECTION_NAME]`` is replaced with the name of your WiFi connection that you got from step 8 and ``[DNS_SERVERS]`` is replaced with a comma-separated list of DNS server IP addresses. Google DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are recommended.
12. To disable DHCP and always use the static IP address on this connection, use the command ``sudo nmcli c mod [CONNECTION_NAME] ipv4.method manual`` where ``[CONNECTION_NAME]`` is replaced with the name of your WiFi connection that you got from step 8.

        .. figure:: img/nx/nx-wifi-step-12.png
                :align: center

                Setting connection to always use static IP.

13. To save the changes you've made, run the command ``sudo nmcli c up [CONNECTION_NAME]`` where ``[CONNECTION_NAME]`` is replaced with the name of your WiFi connection that you got from step 8.
14. To verify that you can SSH into the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit, verify that the Pit/Host PC is connected to the same network as the Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit and use an SSH client on the Host PC to connect to the new IP address of the Developer Kit. On Linux this would be done with the command ``ssh f1tenth@[IP_ADDRESS]`` where ``[IP_ADDRESS]`` is replaced with the static IP address that you assigned to the Developer Kit. After you have verified that SSH works correctly, you can close the connection to the Developer Kit in your terminal emulator and disconnect the micro USB cable.

Updating Packages
-----------------

1. All further steps assume that your NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit is connected to the internet and you are connected to the Developer Kit via SSH.
2. To update the list of available packages, run ``sudo apt update``.
3. To install all available updates, run ``sudo apt full-upgrade``.
4. Once all packages have been upgraded run ``sudo reboot`` to restart the Developer Kit and apply any changes.

Creating a Swapfile
-------------------

1. Run the following commands to create a swapfile which can help with memory-intensive tasks

  .. code:: bash

    sudo fallocate -l 4G /var/swapfile
    sudo chmod 600 /var/swapfile
    sudo mkswap /var/swapfile
    sudo swapon /var/swapfile
    sudo bash -c 'echo "/var/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab'

Installing ROS
--------------

We use ROS to connect everything together and ultimately run the car.
However, before continuing with  the F1TENTH software, you'll need to do a few steps that are specific to the Jetson Xavier NX.
Everything in this section is done on the **Jetson Xavier NX** so you will need to connect to it via SSH from the **Pit/Host** laptop/computer or plug in a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

These instructions are specific to setting up the software on the Jetson Xavier NX as the setup is a bit different than the TX2.
Many thanks to `Jim from JetsonHacks <https://www.jetsonhacks.com/>`_ and `Josh Whitley from The Autoware Foundation <https://autoware.org/>`_ for figuring this out.

1. Install the Logitech F710 driver on the Jetson.

  .. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/logitech-f710-module
    cd logitech-f710-module
    ./install-module.sh

2. Install ROS

  .. code:: bash

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installROS
    $ cd installROS
    $ ./installROS -p ros-melodic-ros-base

3. Create a ROS Workspace

  .. code:: bash

    $ ./setupCatkinWorkspace.sh f1tenth_ws
    $ cd ~/f1tenth_ws/src

  (This step will setup a catkin workspace in the home directory named ``f1tenth_ws``)

After this, you can follow the existing instructions to set up the :ref:`ROS workspace <ros_workspace>` (skipping step 1), set up some :ref:`udev rules <udev_rules>`, and :ref:`test the lidar connection <lidar_setup>`.
